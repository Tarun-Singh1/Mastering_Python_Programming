# 🐍 Python Programming Journey – by Tarun Singh

Welcome to my Python programming learning repository!  
In **2025**, I made a serious commitment to mastering programming, starting with **Python**. This repo documents my **daily learning, revision, and teaching journey**, supported by coding exercises, real project files, and YouTube tutorials.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

Every day, I:
- Learn new Python concepts from a course
- Use **ChatGPT** to explore those concepts in depth
- Practice with coding exercises (with instructions + solutions)
- Build a **mini final project** based on that day's learning
- Share the **complete folder**, **code**, and **learning chat** in this repo
- Upload a **YouTube video** teaching or revising the same

I post:
- Concept explanations
- Code walkthroughs
- Revision sessions
- Mini project building (guided)
- Capstone project creation for each module

## 🧠 Daily Learning Log

❗Day 1 and Day 2 video content and ChatGPT might seem a little different becuase I had no plans of sharing GPT chats until then,
  I made them general and new. Afterwards, things are fine!
