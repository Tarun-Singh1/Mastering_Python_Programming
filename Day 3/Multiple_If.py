# ðŸ§© Challenge: Fitness Tracker
# Write a program that checks three conditions and responds accordingly.
#
# ðŸ”¨ Your Task:
# Ask the user three questions (yes/no answers):
#
# "Did you sleep 8 hours?"
#
# "Did you drink enough water?"
#
# "Did you exercise today?"
#
# Use three independent if statements to print feedback:
#
# If yes to sleep â†’ "Great job sleeping well!"
#
# If yes to water â†’ "Hydration is key!"
#
# If yes to exercise â†’ "Keep up the good work!"
#
# Even if all three answers are "yes", all three messages should be printed.
