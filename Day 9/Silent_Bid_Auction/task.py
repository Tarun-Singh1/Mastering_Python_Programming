# üéØ Project Goal
# Create a Silent Bid Auction program that:
#
# Allows multiple users to place a bid.
#
# Keeps all bids secret (like a silent auction).
#
# Determines who placed the highest bid at the end.
#
# Uses a dictionary to store bids with names as keys and amounts as values.
#
# üßæ Features You‚Äôll Build
# ‚úÖ Ask the user for:
#
# Their name
#
# Their bid amount
#
# ‚úÖ Store the data like this:
#
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# bids = {
#     "Alice": 100,
#     "Bob": 250
# }
# ‚úÖ Keep asking for new bidders until someone types "no" when asked if there are more bidders.
#
# ‚úÖ At the end, display the name and amount of the highest bidder.
#
# üß† Hints & Concepts to Use
# Use a while loop to keep the program running.
#
# Store the name as the key, and bid amount as the value in a dictionary.
#
# Use a function to find the highest bid and bidder.
#
# Use clear() to clear the screen (you can simulate it if you're in a browser or IDE).
#
# Convert bid amount to an integer or float before storing.
#
# Use a flag to control when the loop ends.

  !howl!        during the construction phase of
