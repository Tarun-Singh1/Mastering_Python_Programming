# 🎯 Final Project: Guess the Secret Number Game
# 🕹️ Description:
# You will create a simple number guessing game. The program will:
#
# Greet the user using a function.
#
# Pick a secret number (hardcoded or random).
#
# Use a while loop to let the user guess the number until they get it right.
#
# After the correct guess, it congratulates the user and ends.
#
# ✅ Features You’ll Use:
# Function for greeting
#
# Input from the user
#
# while loop to keep asking for a guess
#
# Condition to break out of the loop
#

# 🔧 Instructions:
# Define a function greet_user() that prints:
#

# Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
# Try to guess the secret number between 1 and 10.
# Define a secret number (e.g., 7)
#
# Create a while loop that:
#
# Asks the user to enter a guess.
#
# Compares it to the secret number.
#
# If it’s wrong: say “Try again!”
#
# If it’s right: say “Congratulations! You guessed it!” and break the loop.
