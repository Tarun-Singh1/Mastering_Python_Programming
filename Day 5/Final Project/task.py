# 🎮 Final Project (Real World & Fun): "Password Strength Checker"
# 🎯 Objective:
# You’ll create a simple password strength checker that:
#
# Accepts a password as input.
#
# Analyzes the password character-by-character using a for loop.
#
# Counts:
#
# Uppercase letters
#
# Lowercase letters
#
# Digits
#
# Special characters
#
# Based on the counts, gives a final "strength rating".
#
# 🧰 What You'll Practice:
# Strings and character iteration
#
# Loops (for)
#
# Conditions (if-else)
#
# range() (can be used to test multiple passwords)
#
# Built-in string methods like .isupper(), .islower(), .isdigit()
#
# ✅ Example Output:
# Input:
#
# graphql
# Copy
# Edit
# Enter your password: Hello@123
# Output:
#
# yaml
# Copy
# Edit
# Analyzing password...
#
# Uppercase letters: 1
# Lowercase letters: 4
# Digits: 3
# Special characters: 1
#
# Password Strength: STRONG 💪
# 📐 Rules for Strength:
# WEAK: Less than 6 characters or only one character type
#
# MODERATE: Contains at least 2 of these — upper, lower, digit, special
#
# STRONG: Contains all 4 types and is at least 8 characters long
